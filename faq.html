<h2> Candidates </h2>

 
<ul>
  <li class="faq-question">How does APPLI work?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">Our goal is to match you with positions at companies where you have the greatest culture fit, potential for success, and job satisfaction. 

Our predictive algorithm matches you with positions at companies that fit you best. If you accept a match, we automatically set up an interview. </li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">What makes APPLI different?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">What makes APPLI different is that we’re crazy about culture fit and candidate experience. 

We know that finding a job where you look forward to waking up in the morning and get along with your co-workers is just as important as finding a job that fits your skills. We also know how much the job search sucks. 

We try to make it as easy as possible for you. You only fill out one application to start receiving matches with awesome companies. Companies can’t see your profile until you accept the match, putting you in control of your privacy. </li>
    </br>
  <li class="faq-question">How long does it take to start getting matched?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">We know how busy you are so we made our matching process as quick and straightforward as possible. 

Creating an account and taking the Candidate Analysis takes less than 30 minutes. From there, just sit back and relax while our algorithm matches you with the jobs that fit you best.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">What exactly is a Match?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">A match means our algorithm predicts that you will be a great culture fit and have a high potential for success at an active position with one of our client companies. 

You will receive a Company Match Profile which contains: a written summary of the company and position, links to information about the company.

After you read the Company Match Profile, accept the match by answering why you’re interested in the opportunity and how you believe your experience aligns with the position.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">What happens when I accept a match?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">After you accept a match, we send the hiring manager your completed Candidate Match Profile and automatically schedule an interview pending their availability. 

Once the interview is scheduled, you will receive a calendar invite directly to your inbox!</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">Why do I need to complete my profile for every match, and not just the first?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">We believe completing your unique Candidate Match Profile for each company allows the hiring manager to have greater insight on why you specifically are a great fit for their company. 

This information leads to a better interview and a higher chance of you being hired!</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">Can anyone see my Candidate Profile?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">No chance! Your Candidate Profile is completely private. Companies can only see your profile once you have accepted a match with them.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">Should I accept a match right away or wait to see what other matches I recieve?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">ccepting the match ASAP drastically increases your chances of getting the job!

Because we continue to send you new company matches, you should move forward with your current matches as soon as possible. 

This way you don’t miss out on any opportunities that could be the perfect fit for you.</li> 
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">What types of jobs does APPLI match for?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">We specialize in matching candidates with Programming and Technological positions at high growth companies. 
Although our focus is on engineering at this time, our goal is to expand to all job markets in the future.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">Why haven't I recieved any matches?
</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">We only send matches that are guaranteed to fit your unique skill-set and personality. If you signed up but haven't received a match yet, that means we currently don't have any active positions that match up to you. 

But no worries, we're constantly activating new positions and we'll deliver a match to your inbox as soon as it's generated.</li>

<h2> Employers</h2>
 
<ul>
  <li class="faq-question">Why should I use APPLI to build my team?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">APPLI matches candidates with active positions at your company based on their potential for success and culture fit, the two factors which best predict job satisfaction. 

Unlike other hiring services, every candidate that you see is guaranteed to be a great fit for your company and has already accepted the match.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">How is APPLI different from a recruiter?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">There are two key differences between APPLI and a traditional recruiter. 

The first difference is our matching engine. The candidates we match with your company not only meet and exceed the skill requirements for the position, they are also a great fit with your company culture. 

The second difference is the candidate experience. 99% of our candidates are inbound and we are transparent about the companies we work with from the beginning of the matching process. </li>
    </br>
  <li class="faq-question">How does my company start working with APPLI?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">Start by completing the application on our employer page.From there you will fill out the criterias of your company’s hiring needs, current recruitment strategy, and company culture. 

Get matched and interview with as many candidates as you want, free of charge. Choose the pricing model that best suits you once you make your first hire.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">What is a Company Match Profile?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">A Company Match Profile is a detailed description of your company and the specific position the candidate has matched with. 

It contains information typically found in a job description such as a company bio and the responsibilities and requirements of the position.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">What type of candidates use APPLI?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">Candidates who are attracted to APPLI take finding a job with great culture fit very seriously. Culture fit is the top consideration of many Millennials when choosing a job. 

 We plan to expand into different industries and positions as HireKeep continues to scale.</li>
  </br>
  <!-- <li class="faq-question">At what point will I receive and be able to view a candidate's Match Profile?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">We take candidate privacy very seriously. You will only be able to view a candidate’s Match Profile once they have accepted the match with your company and completed their profile by answering questions specific to the match.</li>
  </br> -->
  <li class="faq-question">How does the interview process work?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">To accept a match, a candidate must first read the Company Match Profile and answer questions specific to the role. These answers ensure candidate engagement and a better interview experience. 

We offer automatic interview scheduling based on mutual availability of the candidate and hiring manager.</li>
  </br>
 <!--  <li class="faq-question">What is the weirdest scar you have and how did you get it?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">I have a scar under my right eye and on my eyelid. I was at a cook out sitting around a fire with friends. The fire popped and a huge ash the size of a quarter landed on my face and melted into my skin. The weirdest thing, you can't even tell now. Freak things like that always happen to me .. </li> 
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">If you could trade lives with one person for an entire day who would it be?</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">A priest. Since I only see them on Sunday they seem so mysterious.</li>
  </br>
  <li class="faq-question">If you could have a drink with someone from history who would it be?
</li>
  <li class="faq-answer">I would want to have a drink with JFK. There are just so many questions..</li> -->
